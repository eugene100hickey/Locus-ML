### Highlights

- Correlations between stellar spectra can be estimated using colour magnitude values.
- The application of machine learning models leads to an improvement in colourmatching stellar spectra compared to previous implementations of the Locus Algorithm.
- Stars classified as Cataclysmic Variables performed poorly in these models. This is connected to the presence of strong emission lines in their spectra.

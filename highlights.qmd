### Highlights

- Differential photometry performs best when comparison stars have similar spectra to the target star.
- Correlations between stellar spectra can be estimated using colour magnitude values.
-   The application of machine learning models leads to an improvement in colour matching stellar spectra compared to previous implementations of the Locus Algorithm.
-   Stars classified as Cataclysmic Variables performed poorly in these models. This is connected to the presence of strong emission lines in their spectra.
